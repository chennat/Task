	<h2>Season 1</h2>
	<p><strong>Main article: Friends (season 1)</strong></p>
	<p>The first season introduces the six main characters: Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross. <br />
	<img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:JenniferAniston08TIFF.jpg" alt="Rachel" style="width: 100px; height: 120px;"> Rachel arrives at Central Perk after running away from her wedding to her fiancé Barry and moves into an apartment with her friend Monica from high school. Ross, who has had a crush on Rachel since the two of them were in high school, constantly attempts to tell her how he feels about her. However, many obstacles stand in his way, such as the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol. Joey is shown to be a bachelor and struggling actor, while Phoebe works as a masseuse and portrays a sort of "crazy" attribute to her personality based on her troubles as a child after her mother committed suicide. However the rest of the group loves her regardless. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry"><strong>Chandler</strong></a> breaks up with girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler), who frequently returns in later seasons. At the end of the season, Chandler accidentally reveals that Ross loves Rachel, who realizes that she feels the same way. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross’ arrival from a trip.</p>

	<p>The second season begins with Rachel waiting at the gate for Ross to declare her love for him. <br />
	However, she discovers that he is dating Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from graduate school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross she likes him mirror his failed attempts in the first season, although the characters eventually begin a relationship</p>.

		<li>Chandler gets back with Janice, his ex-girlfriend from season one.</li>
		<li>Monica begins dating Richard (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend and 21 years her senior. In the season finale, they end their relationship when they realize that unlike Monica, Richard does not want children.</li>
